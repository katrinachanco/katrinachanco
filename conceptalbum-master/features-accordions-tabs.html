<p>Marianas Trench is a pop/punk genre band that has musical influences such as the Beach Boys, Jackson 5, and Queen. The members of the band are from Vancouver, Canada, consisting of Josh Ramsay (Lead singer and guitarist), Matt Webb (Lead guitarist), Mike Ayley (Bass guitarist), and Ian Casselman (Drummer/Percussionist).  
</div><div class ="animate fadeInDownBig col-md-12"><br>
The band was created by Josh Ramsay who grew up with parents that were in the music industry, so naturally he was exposed to musical influences early on in his life, and even formed a band called Ramsay Fiction. However, once Josh got involved with drugs, the band fell apart. After rehab, he got together with some of his previous band mates, and alongside a couple new ones, formed Marianas Trench.

Josh enjoyed the record Smile that was done by the Beach boys and Brian Wilson, since it resembled a pop symphony. This style of music interested him, and inspired the idea of creating a concept album. Artists nowadays have gotten sidetracked with the idea that they only have to make good singles, disregarding the rest of the album. Marianas Trench wanted to make sure that every song had a purpose, and that the order of which they were played did matter. A song that does not end up as a single, would still be important, since it would contribute in some other way.

The band wanted to bring back the essence of what made an album, a good album, and they decided to do this through their concept album Ever After. They wanted to assure people that their money will be well spent buying the whole album, instead of only purchasing a few singles. The concerts should feel like a play afterwards instead of just another concert you go and watch. A key factor to the continuity Ramsay wanted in the album was that the ending would transition into the beginning of the next song. </div>

 It was challenging to accomplish, and he wanted to do it for a long time, it was only through Ever After where he was able to fulfill this dream. They were able to create an album where if you played the songs one after another, in a specific order, it would sound as if it were one hour long song. All together, the songs tell a story, and fulfill Marianas Trench’s goal.</div>

                                                      <p> This song is about someone who is evolving from their old self, to an entirely new being. Even if others criticize them; they want to embrace everything they are; the good, the bad, and the crazy. If people just accepted others for who they are, they would see that the person who is being themselves, is the best version they could be. They want to try to be this new person, and not revert back to their old ways. Even if they may have their doubts; they want to persevere. Looking back at who they were before; they can’t recognize themselves anymore, because they are now an entirely different person. They are ready to accept who they are now, and show the world who they really are.</p>

The situation may not have had the best start, but they believe there is still hope to salvage it. They haven’t been able to get over what happened because the outcome could have been ten times better. By getting this second chance, they will be able to move on, but without it, they will forever be stuck thinking about it. In a sense, they are looking for closure.</p>

Everyone comes to a point in their lives where tough choices have to be made. What we desire most, could evidently be our demise. It is hard for people to step out of their comfort zone and decide to do what is unpopular, even if it is better for them in the long run. Instead of thinking about the future, they only focus on right now, and at this moment, they do not even realize they are suffering. To improve their current state of being; they have to think about what is truly the right course of action for their lives, and take it. If people are unhappy, they have to be willing to do what is necessary, even if it is difficult, in order to get results they wanted. These decisions may be tough, but the person will evidently be better off. Later on they will look back at this moment and feel no regret for what they had done.</p>

                                                        <p>The song is about someone who tries to be adventurous by doing what they have never done before. It supports the idea of how people have to take risks in life in order to be rewarded later on. Many people miss their opportunity to enjoy life by constantly wondering about whether they should do something or not. Instead of living in a world stuck in thought; people should go out and achieve their dreams while the day is still young. Rather than getting caught up in a web of worries, we need to live in the moment. Sometimes we have to stop planning, and start taking action.</p>

                                                        <p>This song is about someone who is trying to get something they want so badly; they are willing to do anything to get it. Their mind will not rest until they have achieved what they set out to accomplish. When people are dead-set on a mission; it is almost impossible to deter their course of action. No matter what obstacle appears, they will do everything they can possibly do to overcome it, even if the task at hand is not the most desirable. Having this kind of mindset, blinds their judgement, and allows people to make rash decisions, as a means of getting what they want. They will only be satisfied once they are successful in fulfilling their goals.</p>

They initially believed that they had everything under control, but as parts began to fall apart; they realized that they did not know as much as they thought they did. People believe that being in a state of confusion is terrible. What they fail to see is that this state of being, will help them figure out where their heart actually lies. We have to be on the fence, so we can figure out what is actually the right choice for us. If our minds were completely made up; we could end up marching in blind. By being confused, we are able to fairly weigh our options, and evidently make a better decision. People need to understand that being in a state of confusion can be beneficial as a means of helping them sort out their lives.</p>

The situation did not go the way they were expecting it too, and now they are left unsatisfied with the outcome. People try to control every aspect of their lives; wanting everything to turn out the way they set out for it to be. However, life is not something to be controlled. There will always be twists and turns thrown our way where the result is what we were not expecting. When thrown into an unwanted situation, we are faced with two options: we could either whine about how life is unfair, or we can deal with what is right in front of us. It may be annoying at first; but this is expected since we had not planned for this outcome. How we handle the situation after a curve ball is thrown at us, is where we see the person’s true character surface. People worry about their petty problems, which is natural; but we have to be able to move on and not stress out over what we cannot control.</p>

The realization that they could potentially achieve what they deemed as only a dream, has only sunk in now. This creates an immense amount of pressure on the person, to the point where their anxiety and nerves take over. When people gain hope for something that they thought was a lost cause; it enacts awareness in the brain, resulting in a wave of mass emotional stress to occur. Once the adrenaline of the situation kicks in, our senses heighten; and our priorities shift to trying to find a way to assure we are victorious in our endeavours. Hope, even a little bit of it, can ignite a spark in someone’s life.</p>

When people trust one another they are more susceptible to accepting advice; potentially becoming a positive influence in each other’s lives. Questions of loyalty arise through the personal relationships people acquire such as family, friendships, or romantic relations. These kind of relationships create strong emotional bonds, and the outcomes of betrayal are ten times worse. The idea of loyalty and faithfulness is ideal on paper, but is hard to achieve in real life. When people truly believe in something; they are loyal to them. Through this, we strengthen our relationships with one another, and interact better with them.</p>

                                                        <p>This song is about someone that is not good enough for the standards of another. It is not possible to please everyone; so people will point out flaws in us, trying to diminish our worth. People get hung up in the idea that they have to be like by everyone. They do not have to live their lives dependent on the societal opinions of them. What people fail to realize is that instead of trying to please others; they should only be working to please themselves. When we stop comparing ourselves to others, we can start to see the beauty in our own lives.</p>

They say that they want to move on, but are unable to because they are not allowing themselves to. There will be times in our lives where we will be in this state of hesitation, unwilling to forget, but wanting to at the same time. In order to get on with their lives; they have to cut off all ties with what is holding them back. However, they are not ready to say goodbye to it all, and therefore are stuck in a limbo state of being. It is at this time where people contemplate about whether or not it is time to flip to the next chapter of their lives. Only when a person is truly wanting to progress forward; is when they will be willing to do whatever it takes to extinguish the haunting thoughts of the past.</p>

                                                        <p>This song is about the journey someone had gone on, and recounts all that they have learned, as well as gives insight into what they plan to do in the future. It gives the perspective of someone who had recently finished going on an adventure. After the commotion and excitement settles, the person sets out to do what they had originally planned to accomplish when they first started their journey. However, as they recount all that they have learned about themselves while being on the journey, they realize that the place where they truly belong is here; where they are able to be their true selves. This song not only analyzes the entire album in a sense, but also describes how an event in our lives can change our perspective, showing personal growth and progression.</p>

                        <p>The theme of this concept album is personal growth. We can see that every song has something to contribute to fully explain the different aspects that affect this theme. A single song would propose an idea of what could possibly affect a person’s personal growth. Then, as each song follows; we are exposed to more material that builds a complex image, which explains the overall theme in more depth. The order of the songs is imperative to understanding the album as a whole. From a musical perspective, each song is ordered in a way where the instrumental ending of one song, leads into the beginning of the next. This album was meant to be listened to all at once; resulting in it to be one, fifty-five minute long song. Playing the songs out of order would destroy the intention of its creation. Lyrics wise, each song has their own stand-alone lesson to it. When combined though, all of the songs tell a story of how someone is able to develop, and grow as a person.</p>

                        <p>The story starts with someone that is unsatisfied with their current lifestyle, so they decide to go searching for something more. Wanting to make a difference in their life; they start changing their attitude by turning away from selfishness, and becoming selfless. Altering our outlook on the world is the first step to making a successful transformation. From there, we have to be brave, and go for what we want.

                        People cannot expect their dreams to magically come true on their own. They have to go out, and make it happen themselves. In the process of reaching for their goals, the passion that drives them, could end up steering them in the wrong direction; as they become desperate, willing to do whatever it takes to get what they want. When in this state of distress, people get confused, delaying their journey of self-discovery. Once they are able to collect themselves, and bounce back; finding their purpose again, they have to realize that the journey will be long. </p>

                      

                        <p>Patience is a key factor when looking to make a drastic change in someone’s life. It is when a person’s goals are in sight, when the realization sinks in that their dreams are within reach. This causes anxiety to emerge since what they thought was once impossible, became possible. After people obtain what they desired; they can only hope that everything will turn out alright, even when others try to deter them. The only way to fully move on, and complete the circle they have been drawing; is to let go of everything that is holding them back. When a person has gone through all of the ups and downs of this journey of growth, they are able to evolve into a new and improved being. As someone looks back on their old life, they can see how effective the transformation was. They are ready to continue and embrace this new person they have become.</p>

 <p>The first song, Ever After, defines the theme of the concept album, foreshadowing what people should be expecting. The next ten songs that follow are examples of aspects in a person’s life that contribute to their overall personal development. No Place Like Home, the last song, is a reflection on the journey of self-discovery the person went through, and how their life was affected by this change in character. Each song was strategically placed, so then the story of how a person grows, is told in the most effective way. We as the listeners learn a little more each song, and are able to envision the story that Marianas Trench wanted to tell. This ordered collection of songs is methodically thought out, and encompasses what it truly means to be known as a: concept album.</p>
